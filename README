Simple script to let user vote on which is his favorite Halloween candy from a random pair.  Results are then displayed along with another random pair.

I know it's not particularly well-designed, but it's my first git project.

Future changes:
-Add AJAX form submits.
-Add more candies.
-Generalize to be able to compare any two objects.
